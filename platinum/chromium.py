'''List of Chromium Command Line Switches.'''


class Chromium(object):
    '''Frequently used commands mappings.
    
    There are lots of command lines which can be used with the Google Chrome browser.
    Some change behavior of features, others are for debugging or experimenting.
    This page lists the available switches including their conditions and descriptions.
    Last update occurred on 2018-05-04 from `https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/`.

    ACCEPT_RESOURCE_PROVIDER = 'accept-resource-provider'   # Flag indicating that a resource provider must be set up to provide cast receiver with resources. Apps cannot start until provided resources. This flag implies --alsa-check-close-timeout=0.
    ACCOUNT_CONSISTENCY = 'account-consistency'   # Command line flag for enabling account consistency. Default mode is disabled. Mirror is a legacy mode in which Google accounts are always addded to Chrome, and Chrome then adds them to the Google authentication cookies. Dice is a new experiment in which Chrome is aware of the accounts in the Google authentication cookies.
    ADABOOST = 'adaboost'   # 
    AEC_REFINED_ADAPTIVE_FILTER = 'aec-refined-adaptive-filter'   # Enables a new tuning of the WebRTC Acoustic Echo Canceler (AEC).

    AGC_STARTUP_MIN_VOLUME = 'agc-startup-min-volume'   # Override the default minimum starting volume of the Automatic Gain Control algorithm in WebRTC used with audio tracks from getUserMedia. The valid range is 12-255. Values outside that range will be clamped to the lowest or highest valid value inside WebRTC. TODO(tommi): Remove this switch when crbug.com/555577 is fixed.

    ASH_HOST_WINDOW_BOUNDS = 'ash-host-window-bounds'   # Sets a window size, optional position, and optional scale factor. "1024x768" creates a window of size 1024x768.

    AUTO_SELECT_DESKTOP_CAPTURE_SOURCE = 'auto-select-desktop-capture-source'   # This flag makes Chrome auto-select the provided choice when an extension asks permission to start desktop capture.
